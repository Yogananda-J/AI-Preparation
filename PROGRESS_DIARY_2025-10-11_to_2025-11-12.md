# Weekly Progress Diary (2025-10-11 to 2025-11-12)

## 2025-10-11 — 2025-10-17
Hours Worked8.0Work SummaryStabilized email OTP verification by adding retry/backoff, server-side rate limiting, and templated emails. Finalized MySQL schema for users, email_verifications, and audit tables. Added verification window and lockout after repeated failures.Learnings / OutcomesShipped: Hardened OTP flow with audit logging and lockout rules. Outcome: Reduced verification failures and support tickets.Blockers / RisksMail API sandbox limits and deliverability to some providers; added fallback mail channel and exponential backoff.Skills UsedSpring Boot, MySQL, JPA, Email Service Integration, Rate Limiting, Observability

## 2025-10-18 — 2025-10-24
Hours Worked10.0Work SummaryPlanned migration to MERN for coding platform features. Defined service boundaries: React (Vite) frontend, Node/Express API, MongoDB for flexible challenge schemas. Evaluated Judge0 and local ACE for execution; drafted run/submit API contracts and environment-driven configuration (API_PREFIX, CORS_ORIGIN, VITE_API_BASE_URL).Learnings / OutcomesShipped: Architecture plan and execution strategy for MERN-based coding platform. Outcome: Clear pathway to implement challenge browsing and code execution flows.Blockers / RisksService fragmentation and domain configuration drift; mitigated via strict API namespacing (/api) and .env conventions.Skills UsedSolution Architecture, React/Vite Planning, Node/Express Planning, MongoDB Schema Design, Judge0/ACE Evaluation, API Design

## 2025-10-25 — 2025-10-31
Hours Worked16.0Work SummaryImplemented Express backend and React (Vite) frontend foundations. Created challenge endpoints (list, daily), submission queue, and integrated Judge0/ACE execution. Added CORS and environment-based domains (CORS_ORIGIN http://localhost:5173, API base via PORT + API_PREFIX). Seeded initial challenges into MongoDB.Learnings / OutcomesShipped: End-to-end path (frontend → backend → judge → results). Outcome: Users can browse challenges and submit code locally.Blockers / RisksLocal environment variance (ports/URLs) causing CORS and baseURL mismatches; standardized .env for frontend (VITE_API_BASE_URL) and backend (PORT, CORS_ORIGIN).Skills UsedReact 19, Vite, Tailwind, Axios, Node/Express, Mongoose, CORS, Env Configuration

## 2025-11-01 — 2025-11-07
Hours Worked18.0Work SummaryImproved execution correctness with robust generic harnesses (Java/Python/JS), function name aliasing, and reflection/inspection-based invocation. Standardized output formatting (fixed 5-decimal floats, JSON-quoted strings). Implemented relaxed verdict comparator (numeric and quoted/unquoted string equivalence). Built dataset resync/prune to align MongoDB with curated merged_subset.json and made seeding resilient to missing files.Learnings / OutcomesShipped: Reliable run/submit across multiple languages and problems; dataset and DB consistency. Outcome: Resolved blank outputs and false WAs, improved dev ergonomics.Blockers / RisksEdge cases in method discovery and formatting; added logging and safe fallbacks.Skills UsedJava Reflection, Python Inspect, Node Streams, Data Cleaning, Mongoose Bulk Ops, Diagnostics

## 2025-11-08 — 2025-11-12
Hours Worked12.0Work SummaryFinalized frontend-backend domain wiring (frontend http://localhost:5173, API http://localhost:4000/api or configured). Added aliases/fallbacks to fix remaining blank outputs (e.g., Zigzag Conversion, Regex Matching). Cleaned dataset examples (removed empty I/O, filtered judge-like snippets) and normalized daily challenges. Stabilized submission lifecycle and user stats updates. How it works: Frontend calls API base; backend builds language-specific harness, executes via ACE/Judge0, applies relaxed comparator, and returns per-case results.Learnings / OutcomesShipped: Stable local domains and dependable run/submit UX. Outcome: Frontend shows correct challenges and consistent verdicts.Blockers / RisksThird-party judge availability and rate limits; added ACE fallback and clearer error surfaces.Skills UsedExpress, Axios Interceptors, Data Normalization, CORS, Problem Harnessing, DX Improvements
